# Introduction
## What is Cicada 3301?
Cicada 3301 is a name belonging to the internet puzzles or the name associated with their creators.

There have been three puzzles - 2012, 2013, and 2014 - to date, the last of which has gone unsolved. They have involved a variety of topics: literature, art, and music, but ultimately one has been dominant: cryptography.

The puzzles are created by a group that calls itself 3301. 3301 is a worldwide organization interested in promoting digital freedoms, security, and privacy.

## Where can I learn how past puzzles were solved?

The Uncovering Cicada Wiki contains the What Happened Pages as resources, and another page for the most recent step: https://uncovering-cicada.fandom.com/wiki/How_the_solved_pages_of_the_Liber_Primus_were_solved

## What is the current step?
We are stuck on Liber Primus, a book filled with runes. We have Gematria Primus (https://uncovering-cicada.fandom.com/wiki/Gematria_Primus) to translate the runes, but there is at least one more layer of encryption on top of that.

There is also a page on the deep web that we must find, the only verification for it being a hash that 3301 provided.
